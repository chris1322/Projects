Question 1:

Pt 2:

(This query figures out the estimated arrival time for shipments by adjusting the dispatch time based on the time zone differences between where it starts and where it’s going. It also adds the estimated travel time from the route to get the final arrival time. Even if a shipment doesn’t have a direct route, the query still includes it using a LEFT JOIN)
