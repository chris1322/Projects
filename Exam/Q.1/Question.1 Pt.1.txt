Question 1:

Pt 1:
(created a store procedure to calculate total distance of shipment where shipping_id = 1)


CREATE PROCEDURE usp_CalculateTotalDistance @shipment_id INT
AS
BEGIN
	SET NOCOUNT ON;

	WITH ShipmentRoutes
	AS
	(
		SELECT
			r.route_id
		   ,r.origin_hub_id
		   ,r.destination_hub_id
		   ,r.distance
		   ,CAST(r.distance AS DECIMAL(10, 2)) AS total_distance
		   ,CAST(r.origin_hub_id AS VARCHAR(MAX)) + ' -> ' + CAST(r.destination_hub_id AS VARCHAR(MAX)) AS route_path
		FROM Routes r
		JOIN Shipments s
			ON r.origin_hub_id = s.origin_hub_id
		WHERE s.shipment_id = @shipment_id

		UNION ALL

		SELECT
			r.route_id
		   ,r.origin_hub_id
		   ,r.destination_hub_id
		   ,r.distance
		   ,CAST(sr.total_distance + r.distance AS DECIMAL(10, 2)) AS total_distance
		   ,sr.route_path + ' -> ' + CAST(r.destination_hub_id AS VARCHAR(MAX)) AS route_path
		FROM ShipmentRoutes sr
		JOIN Routes r
			ON sr.destination_hub_id = r.origin_hub_id)

	SELECT
		@shipment_id AS shipment_id
	   ,sr.origin_hub_id AS starting_hub
	   ,sr.destination_hub_id AS next_hub
	   ,sr.distance AS distance_between_hubs
	   ,sr.route_path AS journey_path
	   ,sr.total_distance AS total_distance
	FROM ShipmentRoutes sr
	ORDER BY sr.route_id;
END;
GO

RESULTS: (See attached images)

EXEC usp_CalculateTotalDistance @shipment_id = 1;

(Also created a store procedure to calculate total distance for all shipments)


CREATE PROCEDURE usp_CalculateTotalDistanceForAllShipments
AS
BEGIN
	SET NOCOUNT ON;

	WITH ShipmentRoutes
	AS
	(
		SELECT
			s.shipment_id
		   ,r.route_id
		   ,r.origin_hub_id
		   ,r.destination_hub_id
		   ,r.distance
		   ,CAST(r.distance AS DECIMAL(10, 2)) AS total_distance
		   ,CAST(r.origin_hub_id AS VARCHAR(MAX)) + ' -> ' + CAST(r.destination_hub_id AS VARCHAR(MAX)) AS route_path
		FROM Routes r
		JOIN Shipments s
			ON r.origin_hub_id = s.origin_hub_id

		UNION ALL

		SELECT
			sr.shipment_id
		   ,r.route_id
		   ,r.origin_hub_id
		   ,r.destination_hub_id
		   ,r.distance
		   ,CAST(sr.total_distance + r.distance AS DECIMAL(10, 2)) AS total_distance
		   ,sr.route_path + ' -> ' + CAST(r.destination_hub_id AS VARCHAR(MAX)) AS route_path
		FROM ShipmentRoutes sr
		JOIN Routes r
			ON sr.destination_hub_id = r.origin_hub_id)
	SELECT
		sr.shipment_id
	   ,sr.origin_hub_id AS starting_hub
	   ,sr.destination_hub_id AS next_hub
	   ,sr.distance AS distance_between_hubs
	   ,sr.route_path AS journey_path
	   ,sr.total_distance AS total_distance
	FROM ShipmentRoutes sr
	ORDER BY sr.shipment_id, sr.route_id;
END;
GO

RESULTS: (See attached images)

EXEC usp_CalculateTotalDistanceForAllShipments;
