Question 1:

Pt 3:

(This query checks for shipments that have been stuck in customs for more than 48 hours. It filters out shipments with a "Customs" status and calculates how long they've been in customs based on the dispatch date. If the time difference is more than 48 hours, it flags those shipments)

SELECT 
    s.tracking_number,
    s.origin_hub_id,
    s.destination_hub_id,
    s.dispatch_date,
    s.expected_arrival_date,
    s.current_status,
    DATEDIFF(HOUR, s.dispatch_date, GETDATE()) AS hours_in_customs
FROM 
    Shipments s
WHERE 
    s.current_status = 'Customs'
    AND DATEDIFF(HOUR, s.dispatch_date, GETDATE()) > 48;
